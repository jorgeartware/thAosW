# Just life

I was browsing social media today and received a request to answer some person’s question asking advice for how to become self-aware.
https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-reach-true-self-awareness-Where-I-know-almost-everything-about-my-behavior-and-why-I-act-this-way

Having a coach to interact with and point you in the right direction helps tremendously. This is a relevant topic for the life of business and entrepreneurship, so I agreed to answer.
My initially-intended-to-be-short answer became an examination of my own approach, so I decided to share it here with all of you:

- How can I become self-aware and understand my own behavior?

Just live. Live with a compassionate mindset.

Enjoy yourself, and while doing so, it doesn't hurt to study some clinical psychology, psychiatry (which involves a lot of medical knowledge) and social psychology. Also, embrace the fact that humans share more similarities than differences, study the people around you and you'll find insights about your own behavior.

Get to understand your inherited values, accept them but re-examine them so you can eject the parts that don't serve your happiness and find new habits to replace those. Listen to your parents, they might be happy to talk about their upbringing, remove yourself from the vicious dynamics of guilt and shame, then talk to your parents’ parents and they will offer pearls of insight to figure out their value framework, their vision of how the world is and the contrast of how they think it should be, study cognitive dissonance.

Do regular personal checkups, get intimate with yourself, keep a diary and read the old chapters from time to time, visit your past: you will laugh, smile, cringe, cry and everything in between, and little by little… you will understand yourself and what you want from life, you'll develop a sophisticated character, sophisticated in the sense of being resourceful to stay on top of your temper, to channel your natural human impulses, to keep on top of situations. To help others and help yourself.

Talk to everybody, listen, pay attention, specially to those on the fringes of social circles, talk to those whom most people tend to apply arbitrary labels to; the “crazy”, the “dull”, the “losers”, the “trash”. The strategy with those who people say are crazy is to offer respect and you will be welcomed inside their world, inside their minds,, talk to those who people say are not a slight shade of crazy, the ones people say are dull, the strategy? same thing: respect, with everyone. Were you expecting any other type of strategy? Life can be simpler and better when you have honest intentions, everyone deserve respect. Always keep in mind the whole picture; which means “subject acting within circumstances”, ‘subject’ has a mindset, and subject's goals are influenced both by their own mindset and by circumstances (hunger; sleepiness; fear; high energy because of calories or high spirit because optimism; etc. Be nuanced, learn the differences.), ‘circumstances’ have all types of contexts and angles ( subject is new in town or in school; or a respected expert overzealous to keep their status in a group; etc.) Find the picture that makes sense and can be replicated, study the known social phenomenons and find the predictable patterns to adjust on new situations. Put yourself on other people's shoes, be understanding and compassionate.

Don't throw away presents and tokens from old relationships just because it may displease anyone, this is your life; friends, lovers and even family can come and go, sadly. So you better find people who respect you, accept your past and truly wish the best for you in all the days to come. Doing the personal checkups will help you see who contributes positively to your life and who is interacting in toxic ways, by then you'll be wise enough to find a way to give them a constructive chance to fix the relationship. There will be pain, accept it and find healthy ways to cope with pain, digest feelings, process defense mechanisms and get rid of emotional disease; pain is certain, suffering depends on how stubborn you are to stay in denial and in the way you deal with pain.

Try your best but don't take it too harsh if things don't work out, give people some time and space to grow before removing yourself from their lives or the other way around. Many times people learn to value what you offered once you are no longer there and they will understand and miss you, other times they just feel insecure and come back for no good reason and without renewed attitude, be compassionate but don't get stuck with stubborn negative destructive people.

Then go again and revisit your past, diary, presents, tokens and everything from time to time, keep writing as often as possible, whenever it helps you organize your mind and emotions, you also need that for future you; it’s your homework and your craft: you will get frustrated with yourself, you will be proud of yourself, you'll be sick of yourself, sometimes you will miss the good ol’ you, you will see the best and worst in you, but most of all, you will wish happiness for that person you are reading in those old pages and for all the people in that person's life. Your life.

To be self-aware: is a way to be here in the now like some say, for sure.  
This requires being thankful to be alive.
To always stay in the driver’s seat.
This is your life to share.  
Your life.
