# Night vision boy

My writers block went away months ago when I touched base with one of the things that matter most to me, gratitude.

A few days ago, I published the first writing for Withonor, which is my new startup project and that writing aims to set the spiritual tone of that company. I'm proud of how that one came out and am glad of how my friends and contacts have reacted to those efforts. But I have some other projects and life itself is sort of it's own project as a whole, I guess this is where my experience as project, program and operations manager must come to fruition.

Yesterday, I decided to finally jumpstart this blog that has been sitting here with just a title that I came up with several years ago when I was keeping most of my thoughts to myself, growing my experience on business and life, aiming to have something substantial to offer, something different from my more intimate blog that is read only by people who really like me and want to be closer to my heart, some must love me a lot as to deal with my sentimentalism, and some at least might find me interesting enough to put up with my ego.

This is not that type of blog, I finally feel ready to offer insight on managing the life of business, punctual advice for people who have decided to embark on a life of entrepreneurship, you'll find that it is very much worth every single effort but that's not new, every entrepreneur tells the same thing about how it's worth it and they're right: you find your true friends, you find your own true strengths and challenges, you find your focus.

I've now survived for a decade to extreme risk taking and can testify first hand that it's also always fun! Even when things are not going your way, you learn and survive [or is it the other way around? who cares, it goes both ways] and you look back and laugh, very much like the other night that I grabbed my longboard and skated downhill through the median strip of the avenue going into increasing G forces and speed, and I didn't hit the floor like some months ago, nope, not this time. Don't be fooled into thinking that I am now a lord of dogtown, I did hit stuff and had to land on my feet while tiptoeing looking silly more than a few times, but, considering the scant neighborhood public lighting, and the fact that the meandering path intended for bicycles is surrounded and invaded by undergrowth… ! … I'd say I did pretty well, and I had loads of fun, there were a few segments in which I handled to stay on the board not for seconds but minutes while maneuvering obstacles, relying on my modest skills and increasingly finer night vision, of which I'm everyday more amazed and now think I might be a tetrachromat, I don't know, developing the ability to see colors in the dark might be a newly acquired skill but it feels like I've always been able to do it, I just needed practice.  

And you my friend, you need practice too. I have more practice in business than skating so hop on board, jump onto the road with me and I will take care of you. I will be starting a couple other blogs, uploading websites, developing apps and writing books too, but most of all, I'll be working more closely with the people I trust.
And for that I am thankful.
With that in mind I was able to put order to my life and organize my ideas into projects, the projects into a robust milestone based plan and a contingency oriented strategy.

Withonor is different for me because this is the first time I’m on the driver’s seat of an ambitious overtaking.
And with that to heart, I assure you every single person who has helped and put their trust in me will be rewarded: those who have invested money on past projects I’ve been part of, those who have leveraged their reputation to lift us entrepreneurs, those whom dedicated time, resources and risked their emotions in me. Some have lost or not profit enough, some have received my help and will continue to do so, some have profit good and will profit some more, we will all keep thriving.
I’ve even been keeping a digital board for years, with the list of people who uploaded free tutorials, courses and resources that have helped me anytime in my life, people who provided frank advice, money, et al. The board has cards with personal notes, all of them deserve benefits and a push too, my success dream is not complete if the people who’s been traveling with me get left behind, we’ve failed together and learned together and you all deserve to win too.
Gratitude helps me get into focus, calibrate my zen, and detect allies for life.

My first advice as a business person is:
Find brave people who respect and reciprocate to gratitude and you'll be surrounded by friends who won't let you down, your time and appreciation for them will never go to waste, all of your lives will be better without a doubt and with honor, of course.

Salud for gratitude and bravery.
